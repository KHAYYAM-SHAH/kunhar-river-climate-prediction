# kunhar-river-climate-prediction
A research-based project applying **Machine Learning and AI techniques** to analyze and predict climate-driven changes in the River Kunhar ecosystem.  
Here teh work is actually done on Google Collab where we to follow following steps:

 - 1st run this Google Collab code on your system
 - 2nd is that your have to upload cleaned-climate-data and then all excel files from 2009 to 2018 at once
 - 3rd is that the data available in these excel sheets are based on factors of temperature, wind, precipitation and water discharge rate.
This model will be used for future forecasting of years like 2026, 2027 and 2028 on basis of previous/historic data of following factors
 - Discharge Forecast
 - Temperature Forecast
 - Precipitataion Forecast
Machine Learning Technique SVRM has been used upon the demand and requirmenst of the client
